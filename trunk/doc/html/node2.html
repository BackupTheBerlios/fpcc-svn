Motivation</A>
</H1>
Driven mainly by the high capacities available in fixed access networks, the imminent end-of-life of circuit-switched equipment, and the huge expectations concerning OPEX (operational expenses) reduction when operating one single IP- based platform, the replacement of circuit-switched voice networks by packet- switched data networks is currently experiencing a strong progress. However, the
architectural	requirements	of	such	large-scale	carrier-grade	IP-based telecommunication systems exceed the complexity of plain IETF SIP networks by orders of magnitude in order to enable satisfactory user experience already for the most important basic service, which is still voice. In this context, the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), has become an important candidate architecture for the access-agnostic covering of all relevant aspects from signaling to media, from QoS reservation to security, charging and billing. Recently, several standardization bodies, namely 3GPP, 3GPP2, ETSI TISPAN and PacketCable, have joined their forces to define an interoperable Common IMS platform, agreeing to maintain one single set of 3GPP standards starting with 3GPP Release 9. Moreover, recognizing the need for interoperability and lower IMS complexity, main IMS vendors and operators have engaged in initiatives like One Voice and Rich Communication Suite Initiative (RCSI), defining minimum mandatory sets for IMS system- and service-level capabilities and features.

<P>
Released under the GNU Public License in 2006, the Fraunhofer FOKUS Open Source IP Multimedia Subsystem Core (OpenSource IMS) implementation has become a cornerstone of the scientific and industrial IMS research community. OpenSource IMS offers a generic, extensible 3GPP Release 7 IMS core network reference implementation, including signaling and security features as well as modules supporting the extension by means of additional interfaces (reference points). However, today's fixed and upcoming Next Generation Mobile Network (NGMN) access technologies and -services, which require network capacities exceeding the ones of existing 3G networks by an order of magnitude, mandate the use of adequate service-specific QoS enforcement mechanisms to maintain a Quality of Experience (QoE) similar to the one guaranteed by circuit-switched voice services. Despite of this urgent need, this function is not implemented by OpenSource IMS.

<P>
Therefore, this apparent gap has been addressed within the application-oriented project BACCARDI (Beyond Architectural Convergence: Charging, SeCurity, Applications, Realization and Demonstration of IMS over fixed and wireless networks) which has been conducted at the Telecommunications Research Center Vienna (FTW) during the years 2008 and 2009. As a result, the BACCARDI IMS QoS Implementation Initiative (BIQINI) has designed and implemented a QoS enforcement function which extends the OpenSource IMS by means of a generic, extensible, 3GPP Release 7 conforming Policy and Charging implementation and the corresponding interfaces. Main parts of the BIQINI concept and implementation have been contributed by the Institute of Broadband Communications (IBK), Vienna University of Technology, with support of FTW and the associated industry project partners Alcatel-Lucent Austria, Kapsch CarrierCom, mobilkom austria, and Telekom Austria.

<P>
The main aim of BIQINI is to provide a highly flexible QoS playground and multi- purpose plug-in for policy repositories, implementing a complex, stateful rules function, supporting active network capacity management as well as the PCC push model. With respect to this feature, BIQINI's Policy Enforcement component extends OpenSource IMS to become a reliable testing platform for Quality of Experience (QoE) for real-time multimedia streams. Note, however, that BIQINI
does not depend on OpenSource IMS, and instead supports integration with other SIP or non-SIP session-based signaling protocols as well.

<P>
In this document we argue that BIQINI provides a clear advancement compared to the current state of the art, most notably the open source Policy and Charging Control Framework (PCC) published by a group of the University of Capetown (UCT) in 2007. In contrast to BIQINI, the UCT PCC operation relies on stateless gate opening and closing, moreover its architectural framework is relatively limited with respect to scalability, extensibility and active link capacity management.

<P>
Within the open source community, in November 2009 the NGN working group of Fraunhofer FOKUS has announced an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) implementation which is supposed to include a PCC. However neither the detailed concept nor the implementation of the OpenEPC has been released so far.

<P>
To the best of our knowledge, these two contributions already conclude our account of current related work. In contrast, commercial PCC solutions are offered by various IMS vendors. However, two factors are prohibitive in deploying these implementations in applied IMS research at universities or other non-profit institutions: from a technical point of view, these implementations are closed source, which hinders additions and modifications at source code level, whereas the cost factor of PCRFs and particularly of PCEFs provides a huge barrier for IMS-related research activities.
